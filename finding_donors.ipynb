    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

   "source": [
    "**Model 1: Decision Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Real-world applications*:  \n",
    "Decision trees are often used in applications where the goal of analysis is creation of clear and transparent rule-based decision-making process. Examples of such applications are bank loan approvals, building of knowledge management platforms for customer service, product planning and business development, and fraud detection [1, 2].\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages*:  \n",
    "There are multiple advantages of using Decision Trees classifiers, such as ease of human interpretation and visualization, ability to handle numerical and categorical variables with little data preparation, and low cost of model training. Decision tree classifiers perform well on large data sets with logarithmic scaling with the number of data points [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disadvantages*:  \n",
    "While decision tree models are easy to interpret, they are often not as accurate as other machine learn algorithms. Decision trees are prone to overfitting if hyperparameters such as maximum tree depth and minimum number of samples in a leaf are not carefully tuned. Decision trees can also be unstable because small variations in data can lead to large variations in the resulting model. Because optimal decision tree learning requires NP-complete time, often greedy learning algorithms are used and possible solutions can lead to locally optimal rather than globally optimal models. Another disadvantage of the decision tree learners is possibility of generating biased trees for strongly unbalanced classes. Finally, decision trees have a difficulty modeling complex concepts, such as XOR [3, 4].\n",
    "\n",
    "*Model Choice Justification*:  \n",
    "The Decision Tree classifier has been chosen for this problem to allow clear understanding of the importance of each variable (factor) when determining whether an individual's income is greater or less than $50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 2: Logistic Regression**  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Real-world applications*:  \n",
    "One of the features of Logistic Regression is its ability to predict probability of discrete outcomes. This ability is useful in many real-world applications, such as Financial Forecasting or Crime Rate Predictions [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages*:  \n",
    "Logistic Regression is a simple yet surprisingly effective technique. It is highly interpretable, can be easily regularized and outputs well-calibrated prediction probabilities [6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disadvantages*:    \n",
    "Since Logistic Regression is a linear fit technique (similar to its sister Linear Regression), producing linear classification boundaries, its most significant drawback is inability to solve non-linear problems, disqualifying it from usage in many types of applications. Although this shortcoming can in some situations be remedied by feature engineering that introduces non-linear terms, it is still not used as a model of choice for non-linear problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another disadvantage of LR is that while its performance for many problems is sufficient, it is easily outperformed by more complex algorithms. Thus, when very high prediction performance is required, more sophisticated machine learning techniques are preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "LR has also performance limitations when modeling independent variables that are not correlated to the target variable or have high correlation with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Model Choice Justification*:  \n",
    "Logistic Regression was chosen as a test model for this problem to provide a baseline model performance (beyond the naive predictor discussed above) as compared to the more complex algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 3: Gradient Boosting Classifier**  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Real-world applications*:  \n",
    "Gradient Boosting Classifiers are widely used for anomaly detection, such as credit card fraud and cyber security [7] or learning to rank tasks (models that provide ranking scores in information retrieval systems) employed by Yahoo and Yandex search engines [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages*:  \n",
    "Gradient Boosting classifiers have high predictive powers, can naturally handle mixed data types, similarly to decision trees from which they consist, and are robust to outliers [9].\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disadvantages*:  \n",
    "The largest disadvantage of GB's is the sequential nature of their training algorithm that cannot be easily parallelized, making them not very scalable [9]. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Model Choice Justification*:  \n",
    "GB was chosen for its typically superior predictive performance.\n",

After pre-processing the data to ensure compatibility with the selected models, we split the original data into the Training (80\\% of total number of observations) and the Test (20\\% of total number of observations) data sets. The chosen models were subsequently trained on the Training data set and their performance was evaluated by comparing model predictions to income bracket values provided in the Test set. We selected the best model using the following criteria: F-beta score with beta=0.5 (beta is chosen to reflect our preference to value higher *precision* more than higher *recall*), time taken to train the model, and time taken by the model to calculate predictions on the Test data set.  \n",

    "Our analysis shows that all three models performed significantly better than the baseline Naive Predictor model (f-beta score=0.2917) in identifying individuals making more than \\$50,000. While the Decision Tree classifier achieved both the highest accuracy and the highest F-beta score (f-beta score=0.6263) among the three models on the Training data set, it did not generalize as well to the previously unseen Test data as the Logistic Regression (f-beta score=0.6832) or the Gradient Boosting Classifier (f-beta score=0.7395) classifiers. Although prediction performance of the GB classifier is superior to the LR, the model training and test set outcome predicition calculation times of the GB (train_time=11.99, predicition_time=0.028) are an order of magnitude larger than the LR (train_time=0.39, predicition_time=0.0049).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "However, considering that the application of the model does not require fast response times (i.e. it does not require live updating that could impacting user experience), we believe that the most appropriate model for identification of individuals that make more than $50,000 is the **Gradient Boosting Classifier** with the highest accuracy and F-beta scores."

    "### Question 4 Answer:  \n",
    "Gradient Boosting (GB) classifier is an \"ensemble\" type of machine learning algorithms that combines simple models (or weak learners), in our case decision trees, to create a stronger overall model. GB is a sequential additive algorithm that adds new decision trees to the model during training over time without manipulating the existing trees whose values are fixed [10, 11]. In each round of training (or adding ensemble trees), Gradient Boosting classifier makes a decision on which direction to move the model by examining the residual errors (or differences between current and true predictions) of the previous round of training in a gradient descent type of algorithm. Next a new decision tree is built to predict this new direction and is added to the overall gradient. In effect, GB assumes that on average weak learners may not accurately predict the target outcome and uses additional weak learners to move the overall prediction closer to the true target, reducing the overall model bias [12, 13]. Gradient Bossting classifier makes predictions by adding weighted predictions of each of its ensemble trees. \n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
